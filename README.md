# Machine Learning Resources 

## About this document
I compiled this list when transitioning out of academia into industry. My background is in (quantitative) economics and this list assumes that you know college-level math (calculus, linear algebra, probability/statistics) and some programming (e.g. Matlab).

## Quick start
* Read [ISL](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL) (free) for a gentle introduction to the theory behind important machine learning algorithms
* Read [Hands on ML (Part I)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do) to learn how to code up the most important algorithms in Python
* Take part in a Kaggle Challenge

## Improving your coding skills
* Python
    * Data manipulation: [Python for Data Analysis](http://wesmckinney.com/pages/book.html)
    * Fundamentals: [Learn Python the hard way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org) (free)
    * Important libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `keras`, `tensorflow`
* R
    * Data manipulation and visualization: [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) (free)
    * Fundamentals: [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz), [Writing R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz) (free)
    * Important libraries: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `gbm`, `xgboost`
* Version control
    * [Happy git with R](http://happygitwithr.com) (free)
    * GitHub is your friend!

## Deep Learning
* [Goodfellow/Bengio/Courville](http://www.deeplearningbook.org) (free) for theory
* Google’s  (short) [Tensorflow course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) (free)
* [Hands on ML (Part I)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do) for implementation in using TensorFlow in Python

## Visualization
* The classic for theory: [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/1930824130)
* Workhorse libraries are `ggplot2` (R) and `seaborn` (Python)
* You can build quick, interactive dashboards in R using `shiny` and `plotly`. If you are serious about interactive visualization, then you may want to invest in [D3](https://github.com/d3) 

## Archive
* For a statistical perspective on many ML techniques
    * [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn) (free)
